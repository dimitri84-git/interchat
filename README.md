<h1>interchat <h3>(Not anywhere near finished)</h3></h1>
<p>A project made in C so I can talk to my friends in class</p>

<p>the whole idea of this is that <br>
you have a computer running somewhere<br>
you write down the given ip and port<br>
give the exe or html to a friend<br>
and have them join the chat
